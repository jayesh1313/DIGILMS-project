    <p>Java is a programming language and platform initially developed by Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle. Java is inspired by C and C++ and uses an object-oriented programming model, which means that concepts or things are represented as “objects” that have data fields and methods. One of the biggest advantages of Java is that it runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), meaning that you can execute Java code on any platform that has a JVM, without re-compilation. This is different from C and C++, which require re-compilation for every hardware platform you execute the code on. Java has many other advantages, including automatic memory management. This eliminates hard to understand pointers used in languages like C, which can help Java developers write better code in a shorter period of time.</p>
    
    <p>Java is a very versatile language. Several fields use Java, including Android app development, desktop applications that work on many operating systems, server-side applications, and more. The virtual machine required to run Java programs has been ported to numerous operating systems allowing Java to run on virtually all hardware. According to the TIOBE index, Java has consistently been in the top 3 most-used and popular languages since its initial release in the 1990s. Many developers still consider Java the language of choice in areas such as enterprise and application servers, and even in embedded systems development.</p>
